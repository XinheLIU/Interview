# Fundamental Knowledge and Skills for Data Scientists

## Probability and Statistics

### Distributions

Basic distributions and how they are used in real-life

* Discrete
  * [Bernoulli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_distribution)
  * [Multinomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinomial_distribution)
  * [Poisson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution)
* Continuous
  * Normal

Bayesian Approach

* Explain Bayesian Approach
* Bayesian Regression

### Hypothesis Testing

* Standard Hypothesis Tests
  * T-test, Z-test
  * $\chi^2$ Test
  * F-Test
* [A/B Testing](https://cxl.com/blog/ab-testing-statistics/)

### Causual Inference

[Causual Inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_inference#:~:text=Causal%20inference%20is%20the%20process,when%20the%20cause%20is%20changed.)
